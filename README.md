# Pneumonia detection with classical ML methods
<p align="justify"> Deep learning excels at learning hierarchical representations and handling large-scale data, but classical ML methods, when combined with HOG, a potent local shape and structure feature descriptor, can still deliver impressive performance for specific image recognition tasks. </p>

The impressive results obtained using classical feature extraction methods like Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) highlight their significant role in image classification. With an F1-score of 0.95, along with precision and recall values of 0.90, these findings underscore the effectiveness of feature extraction in accurately representing and discriminating visual patterns. These results demonstrate that classical methods can achieve exceptional performance without the need for complex deep learning models. The efficiency, interpretability, and ability to handle limited resources make classical feature extraction techniques like HOG a valuable choice, particularly in real-time applications.

In conclusion, classical ML methods combined with powerful feature extraction can yield outstanding results, affirming the importance of feature extraction in computer vision tasks. </p>
